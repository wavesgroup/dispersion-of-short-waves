## Governing equations for short waves

* Dispersion in deep water with ambient currents:

$$
\omega = \sqrt{g k} + k U
$$

* Conservation of wave crests:

$$
\dfrac{\partial k}{\partial t} + \dfrac{\partial \omega}{\partial x} = 0
$$

* Conservation of wave action:

$$
\dfrac{\partial N}{\partial t} + \dfrac{\partial \left[\left(C_g + U\right) N\right]}{\partial x} = 0
$$

## Governing equations for long waves

* Sine waves with amplitude $a_L$ and steepness $\epsilon_L$:

$$
\eta = a_L \cos\psi
$$

$$
U = a_L \omega_L e^{\epsilon_L \cos\psi} \cos\psi
$$

$$
W = a_L \omega_L e^{\epsilon_L \cos\psi} \sin\psi
$$
