## Takeaways

* A higher-order solution for short-wave wavenumber yields stronger modulation
  at crests relative to Longuet-Higgins & Stewart (1960)
  (**18%** larger at $\varepsilon_L = 0.1$; **38%** larger at $\varepsilon_L = 0.2$).
* Numerical solutions of the full equation set are:
  1. Consistent with Peureux et al. (2021) in an infinite wave train (unstable);
  2. Stable when forced by long-wave groups;
  3. Consistent with the exact analytical solution up to $\varepsilon_L < 0.25$;

## TODO

* Misalignment of short and long waves
* Scale separation and generalize to a spectrum of long waves
* Can we observe this in the lab?
* Is it important for spectral wave models?
