## Problem statement

* Short waves are modulated by ambient longer waves.
* Well studied but not fully understood; many processes going on.
* Modulation is important for at least:
  - Remote sensing (e.g. *EM return from Bragg waves carry information about long waves*)
  - Numerical wave prediction (e.g. *can different wave bands be treated independently in wind input functions?*)
  - _In situ_ measurements (e.g. *a fixed wave staff measures modulated waves.*)

## One possible look at hydrodynamic modulation

* Linear wave theory takes us a long way.
* Early analytical solution by Longuet-Higgins & Stewart (1960):
  - Peak modulation at long-wave crests and proportional to $1 + \varepsilon_L$
* Numerical simulations by Peureux et al. (2021):
  - Short waves grow indefinitely due to convergence by long waves.
  - Sensitive to initial conditions--unstable if not initialized with L-H&S solution.

## This talk's science questions

* Do stable solutions exist for more realistic long-wave trains/groups?
* Are they different from L-H&S (1960) and Peureux et al. (2021) solutions and why?
* Should they be incorporated in spectral wave models beyond the cumulative MSS in dissipation (e.g. Romero, 2019)?
