## Problem statement

* Short waves are modulated by ambient longer waves.
* True even in absence of wave growth or dissipation
* Well studied but not yet fully understood
* Important for:
  - Remote sensing
  - Numerical wave prediction

## Problem statement (cont.)

* Linear wave theory takes us a long way.
* Early analytical solution by Longuet-Higgins & Stewart (1960):
  - Peak modulation at long-wave crests and proportional to $1 + a_L k_L$
* Numerical simulations by Peureux et al. (2021):
  - Short waves grow indefinitely due to resonance with wavenumber modulations.
  - Sensitive to initial conditions.

## This talk's science questions

* Can we learn more from the linear wave theory about the short-wave modulation?
* Can we generalize higher-order solutions to include net-effects of modulation in:
  - Dispersion relation of spectral wave models?
  - Wind input functions of spectral wave models?
* Does it matter and should we do something about it in spectral wave models?
